Abstr Act: Access to a lawyer at the pre-trial stage of proceedings is an 
essential component of the right to defense in criminal proceedings and 
the right to a fair trial. Access to a lawyer enables the accused to make 
a good decision for his her defence. At present, there is no doubt that 
prompt access to a lawyer constitutes an important counterweight to the 
vulnerability of suspects in police custody, ensures equality of arms and 
provides a fundamental safeguard against coercion. This study analyses 
a suspect’s right to access to a lawyer at the initial stage of criminal 
proceedings in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. The 
first part of the article provides an analysis of the understanding of the 
right to a lawyer at the pre-trial stage as applied by the ECtHR prior to 
the Salduz case. This period in the ECtHR’s case law was characterized 
by a lack of precision as to the temporal limits of the right laid down in 
Article 6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR. The next part shows the changes brought 
about by the judgment in the Salduz case regarding the protection of 
suspects and ensuring their right to counsel. It is argued that the Salduz  
doctrine not only covered the suspect’s access to a lawyer at the initial 
stage of the pre-trial proceedings, but also stressed the obligation to 
inform the suspect of his or her rights, including the right to remain silent.

An important element of the Salduz doctrine was the possibility to 
eliminate evidence obtained during an interrogation conducted 
at an early stage of the pre-trial proceedings in the absence of a 
defense counsel. Further, the paper argues that the standard set 
out in the judgment in the Salduz v. Turkey case was confirmed in a 
number of rulings. The fourth part of the paper draws attention to 
the erosion of the Salduz standard that occurred with the judgment 
in the Ibrahim and Others v. the UK case. The article also brings into 
focus recent judgments of the ECtHR which have reinforced the view 
expressed in the Ibrahim and Others v. the UK case concerning a test 
of fairness of a trial as whole. It is underlined in the conclusions that 
recent ECtHR’s case law does not provide any cause for optimism 
regarding legal assistance at an early stage of criminal proceedings.

resumo : O acesso a um advogado na fase anterior ao julgamento é um com -
ponente essencial do direito de defesa no processo penal e do direito a um 
julgamento justo. O acesso a um advogado permite que o imputado tome uma 
boa decisão em relação à sua defesa. Atualmente, não há dúvida de que o 
acesso imediato à defesa técnica constitui um contrapeso importante à vulne -
rabilidade dos suspeitos sob custódia policial, garante a igualdade de armas e 
fornece uma salvaguarda fundamental contra a coerção. Este estudo analisa 
o direito do imputado a um advogado na fase inicial da persecução penal na 
jurisprudência do Tribunal Europeu de Direitos Humanos. A primeira parte do 
artigo apresenta uma análise da compreensão sobre o direito a um advogado 
na fase anterior ao julgamento, conforme aplicado pelo TEDH antes do caso 
Salduz. Esse período foi caracterizado por uma falta de precisão quanto aos 
limites temporais do direito previsto no artigo 6.º, n.º 3, alínea c, da CEDH. O 
item subsequente apresenta as mudanças trazidas pelo julgamento do caso 
Salduz no que diz respeito à proteção dos suspeitos e à garantia de seu direito 
à defesa técnica. Argumenta-se que a doutrina Salduz não apenas abrangia 
o acesso do suspeito a um advogado na fase inicial do procedimento prévio 
ao julgamento, mas também enfatizava a obrigação de informar o suspeito 
sobre os seus direitos, incluindo o direito de permanecer em silêncio. Um ele -
mento importante da doutrina Salduz era a possibilidade de excluir as provas 
obtidas durante um interrogatório em investigação preliminar conduzido na 
ausência de um advogado de defesa. Além disso, argumenta-se que o standard 
estabelecido no julgamento no caso Salduz v. Turquia foi confirmado em uma 
série de decisões posteriores. A quarta parte do artigo chama a atenção para 
a erosão do padrão Salduz que ocorreu com o julgamento no caso Ibrahim 1981

TEDH, que reforçaram a opinião expressa no caso Ibrahim e outros c. Reino 
Unido a respeito de uma verificação de legitimidade do julgamento como um

oferece qualquer motivo para otimismo em relação à assistência jurídica na

I. Introduct Ion
A suspect’s access to a lawyer at an early stage of criminal 
proceedings and use of a suspect’s statements as evidence are controversial 
issues in literature on the criminal process. Without a doubt, this is 
also an important practical issue which the judiciary faces on a daily 
basis. Participation of a defense counsel in the criminal process not 
only guarantees the right to defense, in particular protection the right 
against self-incrimination, but also prevents all forms of ill-treatment 
of the suspect during interrogation, like the use of intimidation or even 
violence. The right to consult a lawyer also constitutes implementation of 
the principle of equality of arms from the earliest stage of the proceedings 
and provides psychological support to the suspect. Information obtained 
from a suspect at the initial stage of criminal proceedings may be crucial 
for the final outcome of the detainee’s case. 
What also must not be overlooked is that the first procedural 
steps, in particular the presentation of charges and the first interrogation, 
involve stress on the part of the suspect, which can result in rash decisions 
that may have a negative impact on the suspect’s subsequent outcomes.
Such benefits of assistance of a lawyer as psychological support 
or protection against any forms of intimidation go beyond the formalistic 
formula of the right to a lawyer but are inscribed within the concept of 
procedural justice2, which is one of the key principles of a law-abiding

state. Justice in this sense is when a person against or for whom a trial 
is being held becomes convinced that the authorities conducting the 
proceedings have done everything in their power to ensure that the law 
is complied with by acting in accordance with the law, conscientiously, 
and in the best interests of that person3. Thus, the process must be 
fair and based on law, but only if the law respects the dignity of an 
individual, enables an effective exercise of their subjective rights, and 
seeks to ensure equality of arms, which is an inherent feature of a fair 
trial. However, this will not happen when the authorities conducting 
the process take advantage of the defendant’s lack of knowledge, mental 
state, or lack of awareness of their rights. Achievement of such goals as 
establishing the truth4, bringing the guilty person to justice, or freeing 
an innocent person are not the only values in a criminal process; the 
way in which substantive justice is achieved is also important. The need 
for find the balance between substantive justice and formal justice is 
obvious. While sharing W. Hassemer’s view that the search for truth in 
a criminal process is a tool that protects and enhances human dignity, it 
should be pointed out that finding the truth when the dignity of a person 
is violated is unacceptable5. The authorities conducting a process should 
take the utmost care to ensure that the dignity and procedural rights of 
individuals are respected. Against this background, it becomes clear that 
statutory safeguards should be established to protect accused persons

against actions of law enforcement authorities. These can take the form 
of positive measures, such as informing suspects or accused persons 
detention of suspects of their rights or of the possibility of exercising 
their right to remain silent, or creating a statutory procedure for access to 
a lawyer (defense counsel), as well as negative measures as exclusionary 
rules concerning statements obtained without access to a lawyer.
The purpose of this paper is to reconstruct and assess the standard 
of a suspect’s access to a lawyer at the initial stage of criminal proceedings 
in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). This 
Court, which enforces the Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms6, is the most important institution 
of the Council of Europe and plays a significant role in the protection of 
human rights in Europe. At present, the jurisdiction of the ECtHR has 
been recognized to date by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe. 
The ECHR envisages that final judgments of the ECtHR shall be binding 
only on the parties to the proceedings. As transpires from Article 46(1) 
of the Convention, Contracting States undertook to abide by the final 
judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties. Thus, the 
judgments of the Court are formally binding only inter partes. However, 
it can be inferred from Article 1 of the ECHR the Contracting States 
must take into account the ECtHR’s interpretation of the Convention. 
They therefore have an obligation to “safeguard” Convention rights, as 
provided in Article 1 of the Convention. It is not surprising, therefore, 
that Contracting states sometimes draw conclusions also from judgments 
issued against another state, and therefore give an erga omnes effect to 
the case-lawof the ECtHR. It also proves that the judgments of the ECtHR 
enjoy a preventive effect, because other states have amended their laws 
or practices following judgments of the ECtHR against other states7.

in the field of regional human rights protection. It entered into force on 3 
September 1953.

The aim of this paper is not only to show the Strasbourg system 
of access to a lawyer, but also to describe its evolution and answer the 
question of whether de lege lata it ensures effective exercise of the right to 
defense. This approach is particularly important for the 47 member states 
of the Council of Europe, as the standard of access to a lawyer at an early 
stage of criminal proceedings should be similar in their legal systems. This 
is because any difference in the standards of legal protection of individuals 
undermines mutual trust between countries with different justice systems 
and hinders implementation of procedural instruments based on mutual 
recognition of decisions8. Finally, differences in recognizing a suspect’s 
statements made in the absence of a lawyer as admissible evidence can 
to the Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. European Journal

8 It must be noted that the 27 states-parties of the Convention are EU member 
states which cooperate according to the principle of mutual recognition of 
judgments and judicial decisions. Moreover, the European Union’s standard 
regarding access of a suspect to a lawyer at the pre-trial phase of proceedings 
may not be weaker than that provided in Article 6 of the European Conven-
tion on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Human 
Rights that is based on it. As provided in Article 52 § 3 of the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union: “In so far as this Charter con-
tains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for 
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning 
and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said 
Convention. This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more ex-
tensive protection”. About the right of access to a lawyer in European Union 
law, see e.g. DZIERŻ ANOWSKA, Joanna. Access to a Lawyer for a Suspect

lead to problems in the use of such information in different states or in the 
recognition of the final judgments. This problem occurs if incriminating 
statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer 
are used for a conviction.
II. S uSpect ’S acce SS to lawyer S In the caSe law of the 
european  court  of human  rIght S before  the judgment  
In the Salduz  v. Turkey  caSe 
Access of a criminal suspect to a lawyer is governed by Article 6 
§ 3 (c) of the ECHR. It provides that “everyone charged with a criminal 
offense has the following minimum rights (…) to defend himself in person 
or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient 
means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of 
justice so require.” Originally, the right to a lawyer was strictly interpreted 
within the temporal limits of Article 6(1) of the Convention, which 
provides that everyone has the right to a fair and public hearing within 
a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established 
by law. The question arises whether Article 6 of the Convention covers 
the right of access to a lawyer only at the stage of the court proceedings 
or whether it also applies at the pre-trial stage. Already in the 1990s, 
the Court rejected the narrow understanding of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the 
ECHR and in the judgment in the Imbrioscia v. Switzerland case assumed 
that the right of access to a lawyer must be ensured at the pre-trial stage9. 
Since that judgment, there has no longer been any doubt that the right 
of access to a lawyer must be ensured at the pre-trial stage. However, 
the way in which the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR are 
to be respected in pre-trial proceedings should depend to a large extent 
on the particular circumstances of the specific trial. The ECtHR’s case 
law emphasizes the need to ensure access to a lawyer during the pre-trial

phase, usually during interrogations that take place at this stage of the 
procedure, but also provides for the possibility of limiting this right10. 
One example is the judgment in the John Murray v. the UK case11 in which 
the Court underlined that the right of access to a lawyer, which is not 
explicitly set out in the Convention, may be subject to restrictions for 
“good cause”. The Court stated that each assessment of such restrictions 
should be made in the light of the entirety of the proceedings. However, 
this position of the ECtHR was very general and did not explain anything. 
First of all, the jurisprudence of the ECtHR does not provide any precise 
guidance on how to understand the concept of “good cause.” Secondly, 
by assuming that restrictions of the right of access to a lawyer should 
be assessed from the standpoint of compliance with the requirement of 
a fair trial as a whole, the ECtHR significantly weakened the essence of 
this right. Proof of its breach required detailed answers to the questions 
of whether the rights of defense have been respected and whether an 
effective defense by a lawyer is possible in the context of the criminal 
proceedings as a whole. Applying this approach, even in cases of obvious 
violation of the right of access to a lawyer, the Court ruled out a violation 
of Article 6 of the ECHR12. For example, in Sarikaya v. Turkey, it was 
10 However, it should be noted “the right of access to a lawyer arises not only 
when a person is taken into custody or questioned by the police but may also 
be relevant during procedural actions, such as identification procedures or re-
construction of the events and on-site inspections”, see the ECtHR judgement 
of 17 February 2009 in the case of İ brahim Öztürk v. Turkey, application no.

12 For example, in the case of Mamaç and others v. Turkey the Court held that the 
applicants had not proven that the absence of their lawyer during police cus-
tody had affected their rights, see the ECtHR judgement of 20 April 2004 in 
the case of Mamaç and others v. Turkey, application no. 29486/95, 29487/95 
and 29853/96, § 43. See also SCHLEGEL, Stephan; WOHLERS, Wolfgang. 1987

found that no such violation occurred despite the fact that the suspect 
was denied contact with an attorney for 20 days. In this case the Court 
held that the applicant enjoyed “overall fairness” by benefitting from 
legal assistance at the trial. 
In contrast, the ECtHR had a different opinion about the violation 
of the right to access to legal assistance at the pre-trial stage when the 
national legislation permitted to draw adverse inferences from the suspect’s 
silence at police questioning, and the applicant’s right of access to a lawyer 
had been restricted.
For example, in John Murray v. the UK, the ECtHR pointed out 
that access to a lawyer is of paramount importance for the rights of the 
defense at the initial stage of police interrogation, where exercising the 
right to silence may lead to adverse inferences. If the suspect chooses to 
remain silent, adverse inferences may be drawn against him. Therefore, it 
is not surprising that the ECtHR’s stated that “to deny access to a lawyer 
for the first 48 hours of police questioning, in a situation where the 
rights of the defense may well be irretrievably prejudiced, is - whatever 
the justification for such denial - incompatible with the rights of the 
accused under Article 6.”13 A similar conclusion of the Court can be found 
in the Kolu v. Turkey case14. It seems that reasons behind the different 
approach of the ECtHR to the right of access to a lawyer in a situation

14 In that judgment, the ECtHR assumed that the lack of access to a lawyer 
when the applicant made an incriminating statement during an interroga-
tion by police and the circumstances of the case did not indicate that he had 
been advised of the right to be assisted by a lawyer and the right to remain 
silent, resulted in an infringement of the right under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the 
ECtHR judgement of 2 August 2005 in the Kolu v. Turkey case, application no. 
35811/97, http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-70013; see also the ECtHR 
judgement of 6 June 2000 in the Magee v. the United Kingdom, application no. 
28135/95, §§ 44-45, “http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-58837. 1988 | SAkowIcz, Andrzej.

of violation of the right to silence is due to the high rank of this right. In 
numerous rulings, the ECtHR has expressed that this right is a “generally 
recognized international standard which lies at the heart of the notion 
of a fair procedure under Article 6 of the ECHR.”15 Unsurprisingly, the 
ECtHR asserted the right to silence as a rationale for the right to early 
access to a lawyer, because the latter right is considered to be a safeguard 
of the enjoyment of others rights.
When summarizing the above observations, it must be said that 
in the pre-Salduz jurisprudence, the ECtHR recognized the importance 
of the right of defense during the first interrogation of a suspect by 
an investigating officer, a member of the public prosecutor’s office, or 
an investigating judge. In many judgments the ECtHR perceived that 
a lawyer is the one who explains to the suspect their rights, presents 
the legal situation. Moreover, his presence during the interrogation is a 
guarantee against ill-treatment of the suspect. However, there have not 
been any judgments which defined the point in time at which the right 
to legal assistance arises, or which would precise the scope of admissible 
restrictions on the right of access to a lawyer (in particular due to the 
undefined nature of the term “good cause”). The then jurisprudence of the 
ECtHR also did not define the admissibility of using as evidence statements 
of a suspect given without access to a lawyer. Consequently, this meant 
that the assessment of a violation of the fairness of the proceedings in 
which the right of access to a lawyer was not ensured required account to 
be taken of the specific circumstances of each case and the legal system16. 
Thus, the failure to provide access to a lawyer at the initial stage of a 
criminal prosecution did not necessarily automatically mean that the 
ECtHR found a breach of Article 6 § 3 (c) in conjunction with Article

6 § 1 of the ECHR, since that right, which is not expressly provided for 
in Article 6 of the ECHR, could be the subject of justified restrictions 
which, however, in the context of the proceedings as a whole, should not 
deprive the accused of a fair trial17.
III. t he judgment  In the Salduz  v. Turkey  caSe 
A breakthrough in the case-law of the ECtHR in terms of its 
approach to the issue of access of a suspect to a lawyer at the initial stage 
of criminal prosecution was the ruling in the Salduz v. Turkey case18. The 
17 Sometimes it was even claimed that Article 6 § 3 (c) does not specify the

ruling articulated the principle that any suspect has a right of access to 
a lawyer from the time of his or her first police interview as follows:   
“... in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently ‘practical 
and effective’ ..., Article 6 § 1 requires that as a rule, access to a 
lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a 
suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the 
particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling 
reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may 
exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – 
whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights 
of the accused under Article 6 (of the ECHR”)”19.
In the Salduz judgment it was found that for the first interrogation 
of a suspect, the Letter of Rights, including the right to remain silent, 
is insufficient, but it is necessary to provide the individual with access 
to a lawyer20. This is due to the belief that “prompt access to a lawyer 
constitutes an important counterweight to the vulnerability of suspects 
in police custody, strengthen equality of arms between the investigating 
or prosecuting authorities and the suspect”21, and contributes to the 
prevention of miscarriages of justice.

In justifying the judgment in Salduz case, the ECtHR stressed that 
“systematic restriction on the right to be assisted by a lawyer during the 
pre-trial phase could not constitute a compelling reason”, as a basis for 
limiting the right to lawyer22. Such restrictions to having a defense counsel 
at the pre-trial stage are not compensated for either by the fact that the 
accused has a defense counsel during court proceedings or by the fact that 
all the evidence against him or her is presented out in conditions of full 
adversariality at the trial. As a consequence, the Court found that the right 
to defense will be irretrievably prejudiced if incriminating statements are 
used for a conviction and the court believes the explanations made during 
the investigation. This was clearly emphasized by the Court when it stated 
that: “neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the 
adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which 
had occurred during police custody.”23 In this regard, Giannoulopoulos 
rightly points out that the use of confessional evidence obtained during 
custodial interrogation without access to a lawyer irretrievably prejudices 
the right to a fair trial and amounts to automatic violation of the Article 
6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR24, unless there were compelling reason for the 
case; organizing the defense; collecting evidence favorable to the accused; 
preparing the accused for questioning; supporting the accused in distress; 
checking the conditions of detention; and helping to ensure respect for the 
right of the accused not to incriminate himself; see more JACKSON, D. John,

interview. However, the restrictions applied, even if justified, could not 
undermine the right to a fair trial, and they must be exceptional25. 
The „Salduz” doctrine applies in case of vulnerable suspects. 
Vulnerability may be caused by various circumstances. In the Salduz case, 
it was the young age of the suspect. The ECtHR noted that, in the case 
of suspects who are children as defined by international standards (i.e. 
persons under the age of 18 at the time of an interrogation as suspects), 
it is not enough merely to inform them about their right to remain silent 
and their right to have a lawyer. It stated that juvenile suspects and other 
persons who can be classified as vulnerable suspects (e.g. the elderly, 
persons with mental disabilities, or persons with a pre-existing heart 
condition) are not able to assess their legal situation and knowingly 
exercise their right to remain silent, even if they have been properly 
advised about it26. 
In short, it seems that the ECtHR decided to depart from its 
previous holistic approach. This is of particular importance in view of 
the ECtHR’s statement that the rights of the defense will in principle be

irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during 
police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used as evidence and 
constitute a basis for conviction. It seems that the Court simply considered 
the first questioning of a suspect by the police to be a crucial moment 
of great importance for the criminal proceedings as a whole. From this 
viewpoint, in the case of vulnerable suspects, the use of incriminating 
explanations given by suspects in the absence of their defense counsels or 
in situations where suspects are unable to consult their defense counsels 
before starting the interrogations as evidence has become inadmissible. In 
such a situation, denial of access to a lawyer cannot be seen as a harmless 
error, which can be corrected. 
However, notwithstanding the fact that the judgment in the  Salduz 
v. Turkey case was limited in terms of the object, it can be assumed that 
it reaffirmed the suspect’s right to legal assistance of a lawyer as one of 
the fundamental characteristics of a fair trial. It also clarified the standard 
of access to a lawyer for a suspect in police custody. At the same time, 
it must be added that assigning a counsel does not in itself ensure the 
effectiveness of the assistance he or she may afford an accused. In order 
to exercise their right to defense, a suspect must be possible to consult 
with his or her lawyer prior to an interview and the lawyer must be 
physically present during their initial police interviews27.

IV. poSt-Salduz  caSe-law
The standard set out in the judgment in the Salduz v. Turkey case 
was confirmed in the Tikhonov v. Ukraine case28. The judgment recognized 
that suspects are not able to assess their legal position at an early stage 
of the proceedings and to consciously exercise their right to remain 
silent, even if they have been properly informed about it. Of a significant 
influence on this position was the fact that in this case, during detention 
and before the first interrogation, the suspect was informally questioned 
by law enforcement officers29. The Court perceived that this form of 
detention effectively deprived the suspect of prompt judicial review of his 
detention and exposed him to a risk of unlawful pressure and coercion. 
Consequently, it could not be assumed that the suspect waived his right to 
a lawyer in circumstances which were attended by minimum safeguards 
commensurate to the importance of such a waiver30.A similar opinion 
was expressed in the Panovits v. Ciprus31 case where it was found that the 
applicant’s right to a fair trial was violated as a result of failure to allow 
him to exercise his right to defense in the pre-trial proceedings (Article 
6 § 3 (c) in conjunction with Article 6 §1 of the ECHR) and because of 
the use as evidence of explanations of the accused obtained in violation 
of the standards of fair trial (Article 6 § 1 of the ECHR). The key fact of 
the case was that the 17-year-old suspect was not offered the assistance 
of a defense counsel before the interrogation and the suggestion that a 
defense counsel should be sought was given only to the applicant’s father 
when the suspected minor was already being interrogated. In view of

these circumstances the Court noted that “the right of an accused minor 
to effective participation in his or her criminal trial requires that he be 
dealt with due regard to his vulnerability and capacities from the first 
stages of his involvement in a criminal investigation and, in particular, 
during any questioning by the police..”32. Thus, under the case law of the 
ECtHR, the right to counsel as from the initial stages of criminal justice is 
considered a fundamental value of the right to a fair trial, with particular 
relevance for the position of minors subjected to police interrogations, 
as individuals in need of additional protection Such a position of the 
ECtHR was based on the assumption that the applicant and his father 
did not expressly and unequivocal waive appellant’s right to lawyer prior 
to his interrogation33. 
In the Panovits v. Cyprus case, the applicant also raised the claim 
of use in court proceedings of the applicant’s explanations given in the 
pre-trial proceedings. With reference to the claim, the Court pointed 
out that the applicant’s admission of guilt obtained in circumstances that 
infringed the standards of Article 6 of the Convention was the decisive 
proof on which the charges in the case were based. This significantly 
reduced the applicant’s chances of being able to defend himself effectively 
at the stage of the court proceedings and, consequently, irreparably 
undermined his rights of defense34. This could only be avoided in one way, 
32 The ECtHR judgement of 11 November 2008 in the case of Panovits v. Cyprus 
application no. 4268/04, § 67. 
33 This conclusion was criticized by Judge ad hoc Erotocritou, who in his dis-
senting opinion drew a distinction between the denial of a right to access 
legal assistance and a failure to inform the individual of the existence of such 
a right. The ECtHR Judge Erotocritou observed that the applicant, less than 
24 hours after his arrest, had the services of a lawyer, who represented him at 
the remand proceedings the very next day. Within one week he appointed he 
appointed a second lawyer and, throughout the one and a half years the trial 
lasted, he was at all legally represented and had the opportunity to test all the 
evidence, see dissenting opinion of the ECtHR Judge ad hoc Erotocritou, the 
judgement of 11 November 2008 in the case of Panovits v. Cyprus, application 
no. 4268/04. See also OGORODOV A, Anna; SPRONKEN, Taru. Legal Advice

namely by not allowing the use of self-incriminating statements made by 
the suspect in the pre-trial proceedings before he had the opportunity 
to consult his lawyer. 
The line of judgments known as the “Salduz doctrine”35 also 
includes the judgment issued in the Płonka v. Poland case36 in which the 
ECtHR found a violation of Article 6 § 1 in conjunction with Article 6 
§ 3 of the ECHR. In this case, the applicant signed the report from the 
interrogation, while being informed about her right to a lawyer and 
her right to refuse to testify. The applicant was arrested on a charge of 
murder. The day after her detention, she was presented with the charges 
and familiarized with the list of procedural rights and obligations, which 
she confirmed with her handwritten signature. On that day the suspect 
was interrogated by a prosecutor. In her explanation one day and two 
days after the arrest, she stated that the victim (the deceased) was a 
friend of hers from work with whom she used to consume alcohol. 
She also raised the fact that she had been an alcoholic for 20 years 
and that she did not remember the whole event exactly, but only 
that there was an argument between her and the victim while they 
were drinking alcohol together and that she hit him a few times with 
scissors. In deciding the case, the ECtHR found that the suspect had not 
made a clear and unequivocal waiver of her right to a defense counsel, 
particularly during the interrogation when the applicant pleaded guilty 
in the absence of her lawyer. Although the applicant withdrew her 
previous statements in the course of the court proceedings, it was 
the explanations submitted to the police officers that influenced her 
conviction and the final judgment.

The Court pointed out that the effectiveness of a waiver of rights 
under the ECHR depends on whether it takes place in an express and 
irrevocable manner and is accompanied by the provision of minimum 
guarantees appropriate to the gravity of the waiver37. According to the 
Court, in the circumstances of the case, the notification, provided in the 
rights and obligations form, of the right to remain silent and to have a 
lawyer cannot be regarded as reliable, since the suspect suffered from 
an alcoholic disease and, together with the deceased, drank a significant 
amount of alcohol one day before her detention. There should be no doubt 
that the suspect was a vulnerable suspect and, therefore, the authorities 
conducting the process should have taken this fact into account during the 
interrogation, in particular with regard to the assessment of her right to 
have a lawyer during that part of the procedure38. Having regard to those 
circumstances, the Court found that the absence of a defense lawyer at 
the first hearing undoubtedly had a negative impact on her procedural 
situation. Consequently, neither the subsequent representation of the 
applicant by a defense counsel nor the adversarial process of the court 
proceedings were capable of offsetting the negative consequences of the 
absence of a lawyer at the first interrogation.
In summary, several conclusions can be drawn from the statements 
of the ECtHR based on the judgment in the Salduz v. Turkey case. First of 
all, the court clearly emphasized the importance of legal assistance during 
the pre-trial phase. One might even say, that this constitutes formulation 
of the principle that as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as 
from the first interrogation of a suspect. However, the Court did not accept 
it in an absolute form, by pointing out that if, in the light of the specific

circumstances of the case there are compelling reasons for restricting 
that right, that is permissible, although it must be exceptional39.
Secondly, it is not permissible to use self-incriminating statements 
made by the suspect during the pre-trial proceedings before he or she 
had the opportunity to consult his lawyer. The ECtHR rightly underlined 
that a suspect’s position at the early stage of criminal proceedings is 
particularly vulnerable also due to the complexity of rules governing 
gathering and use of evidence in criminal case40. 
Thirdly, for vulnerable suspects, advising them of their rights is not 
sufficient. If these persons are unable to assess their situation properly 
and understand the procedural consequences of waiving their right of 
access to a lawyer and their right to remain silent, it is the duty of the 
authorities conducting the proceedings to ensure that they are able to 
get the assistance of a lawyer before the first interrogation. Fourthly, if 
the suspect is conscious and there are no other circumstances suggesting 
that he or she should be considered as a vulnerable suspect, he or she may 
effectively waive the right of access to a lawyer and the right to remain 
silent, if he or she has been informed of this before the first interrogation41. 
He or she must make a free and informed decision to waive his or her 
rights. The mere fact of proceeding to provide explanations cannot be 
regarded as an effective and fully informed waiver of the right to have a 
defense counsel if the suspect has previously, prior to the interrogation,

requested to be given access to his or her defense counsel, which has 
been ignored by the law enforcement authorities42. 
The use of the Salduz doctrine in ECtHR’s case-law confirm that 
the right of access to a lawyer does not arise solely in connection with 
possible interrogation of a suspect by the police and the risk of such 
a person giving incriminating statements. It applies during the entire 
interrogation phase and not simply prior to, or during, the questioning 
of the suspect43. As indicated in the Dayanan case44, the fairness of 
proceedings requires that lawyer be to accomplish the fundamental aspects 
of defense: discussion of the case, organization of the defense, collection 
of evidence favorable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support 
of an accused in distress and checking of the conditions of detention45.
The applicant in this case remained silent throughout the entire 
period of police detention as well as during the trial. He was found guilty 
of belonging to a terrorist group based on other evidence. However, the 
Court found a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the ECHR in conjunction with 
Article 6 § 3 (c) in that the accused had no access to a lawyer during the 
time spent in police custody. The judgment in the Dayanan case was a 
decisive step towards an autonomous understanding of the right to legal 
assistance and the right to defense in the case law of the ECtHR. Whilst 
recognizing the importance of this right, the Court was right to conclude

that a breach of Article 6 § 3 (c) does not require proof that the absence 
of a lawyer during the initial police custody harmed the interests of the 
accused, e.g. by resulting in him giving testimony that incriminated him. 
In other words, the Court ruled that, generally speaking, restrictions on 
the right of access to a lawyer automatically constituted a breach of the 
accused’s right to a fair trial
Finally, in Pishchalnikov v Russia, the ECtHR removed any doubts 
concerning the need for about the lawyer’s presence at questioning, by 
holding that “who had expressed his desire to participate in investigative 
steps only through counsel, should not be subject to further interrogation 
by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him”46. Such 
firm statements by the ECtHR allow us to assume that the Salduz doctrine 
also included the rule prohibiting the use of statements obtained during 
police interrogation in the absence of lawyers at trial, unless the suspect, 
fully aware of the significance and consequences of his decision, waives 
the opportunity to consult a counsel and the right to remain silent. The 
existence of such a prohibition was intended to prevent situations where 
the right to defense is irretrievably prejudiced. There is no doubt that 
such prejudice determines the overall fairness of a trial per se  and is 
irreparable. It cannot be remedied without the exclusionary rule.
IV. eroSIon of the Salduz  doctr Ine
The Salduz doctrine dominated the ECtHR’s case-law for 8 years 
until the landmark judgment in the Ibrahim and Others case47. Before 
any conclusions can be drawn from this case, the facts of the case 
46 See, the ECtHR judgement of 24 September 2009 in the case of Pishchal-

should be described in a few words. This case involved four bombers 
who planted explosives on the London transport system. The first three 
suspects were arrested and questioned by the police in urgent “safety 
interviews”. The interviews were held prior to providing the suspects 
access to legal advice. Under the Terrorism Act of 2000, interrogation 
could take place in the absence of a lawyer even before the detainee 
was given the opportunity to request legal assistance. During the 
interrogations, the suspects in question denied their involvement in 
the attacks and their explanations given during the “safety interviews” 
were counted as evidence for the purpose of the criminal trial. The 
Court had no doubt that at the time of their initial questioning by the 
police there was “an urgent need to avert serious adverse consequences 
for the life and physical integrity of the public”. This allowed the Court 
to conclude that there were compelling reasons for the temporary 
restrictions on their right to legal advice. The legal situation of the 
fourth applicant was different. He was not suspected of detonating a 
bomb and was initially questioned by police as a witness. During his 
testimony, however, he began to incriminate himself by confirming his 
relationship with one of the suspects immediately after the attacks and 
providing information about the help he gave him. Nevertheless, he was 
not formally detained or informed of his right to remain silent and his 
right to legal aid at that time. It was only after the interrogation was 
completed that he was formally detained and given legal assistance. 
Under the circumstances, the ECtHR concluded that the overall fairness 
of fourth applicant’s trial had been prejudiced by restricting his access 
to legal advice48. 
An analysis of the justification in the Ibrahim and Others case 
allows to draw the conclusion that for the ECtHR the right to early 
access to a lawyer is not aim in itself. In this case again the holistic 
approach was applied providing that each violation of this right must 
be examined with regard to the development of the proceedings as 
a whole and “not on the basis of an isolated consideration of one

of Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom, application no. 50541/08,

particular aspect or one particular incident”49. Further on, the Court 
unequivocally stated that “where a respondent government have 
convincingly demonstrated the existence of an urgent need to avert 
serious adverse consequences for life, liberty or physical integrity in a 
given case, this can amount to a compelling reason to restrict access to 
legal advice for the purposes of Article 6 of the ECHR.”50 In allowing 
an exception to the right of access to counsel, the Court added that 
the criterion of compelling reasons should be based on domestic law 
and interpreted narrowly51. 
The ECtHR stressed, however, that even the absence of compelling 
reasons does not automatically lead to a violation of rights under Article 
6. Also in this situation, it is necessary to conduct to overall fairness 
test in order to decide on the violation of Article 6 rights. An important 
consequence of the judgment in the Ibrahim and Others  case was that the 
ECtHR clarified the test on whether a restriction on access to a lawyer 
is compatible with the right to a fair trial. The test set out in Salduz was 
composed of two stages. In the first stage the Court must assess whether 
or not there were compelling reasons to justify the restriction on the right 
of access to a lawyer. In the second stage, it must examine the impact of 
the restriction on the overall fairness of the proceedings. Unfortunately, 
in the Ibrahim and Others case the Court confirmed the need for both the 
two-stage test and accepted the possibility that evidence obtained from 
a suspect in violation of his right of access could be used to his prejudice 
at his trial. Moreover, in this case a non-exhaustive list of factors to be 
taken into account when assessing the proceedings as a whole was adopted 
defined, i.e.: the age or mental capacity, the legal framework governing 
the pre-trial proceedings and the admissibility of evidence at trial, the 
opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and oppose its 
use, the use to which the evidence was put, and in particular whether 
the evidence formed significant part of the probative evidence upon 
which the conviction was based, whether the assessment of guilt was

performed by professional judges, and the weight of the public interest 
in the investigation52.
The adoption of the above “non-exhaustive list” of factors to be 
taken into account in order to assess the impact of procedural failings at 
the pre-trial stage resulted in a departure from the standard of access to 
a lawyer at the pre-trial stage as proposed in the Salduz case. The list of 
circumstances, presented by the ECtHR, is arbitrary. Consequently, the 
predictability of the Strasbourg Court’s decisions is limited. Depending 
on the failing that is found to be decisive, it may turn out that obtaining 
incriminating evidence in the absence of a lawyer and its use in the trial 
is not decisive for verification of procedural fairness. Moreover, the very 
selection of the failings that occurred at the pre-trial stage is unclear. It 
is unreasonable to place in the same category the infringement of the 
rights of a vulnerable suspect, with the possibility of using incriminating 
statements obtained from an interrogated person who has been deprived 
of any contact with a lawyer, and a situation where the assessment of an 
accused person’s guilt was made by a professional judge or a jury and the 
weight of the public interest in the investigation and punishment of the 
particular offense in issue. Nor can it be concluded that adjudication of a 
case by a jury or the possibility of challenging in a trial the incriminating 
statements obtained from a suspect when his or her right to be assisted 
by a lawyer had been restricted is in any way likely to “heal” the criminal 
process as a whole when one of the main determinants of fairness of the 
criminal proceedings, i.e. the right to a lawyer, has been violated in the 
pre-trial proceedings. This is true regardless of how we view the rules of 
analysis of failings that occur at the pre-trial stage that were adopted in 
the Ibrahim and Others case and in what configuration they occur. This 
is because, the right to defense is always irreversibly compromised when 
incriminating testimony given without access to a defense counsel is used 
in criminal proceedings. Finally, it should be added that the negative effect 
of the ECtHR’s approach is that, in principle, there is no clear country-
specific guidance on how to create national rules for ensuring effective

access of suspects to lawyers. The ECtHR’s imprecise way of assessing 
the fairness of the proceedings requires a case-by-case approach and 
makes it difficult to decide in general way that could serve as a binding 
guide on how the various factors affect the assessment of compliance 
with the procedural fairness requirement.53
The judgment in the Ibrahim and Others case, due to the large 
number and the variety of the criteria for assessing the fairness of the 
proceedings as a whole, opened the possibility to reduce the guaranteed 
protection as regards access to a lawyer. Also not without significance 
was the ECtHR’s conclusion that even where there has been an unjustified 
restriction of the right of access to a lawyer and the suspect has made 
incriminating statements and these have been used against him or her, 
a breach of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR does not have to have taken 
place. After Ibrahim and Others case, the erosion of the Salduz doctrine 
quickly began, with the consequent weakening of the suspect’s rights at the 
initial stage of criminal proceedings. This is evidenced by the judgments 
issued following the judgment in the Ibrahim and Others case in which 
the Court found no infringement of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR, even 
though the applicant was unjustifiably denied access to a lawyer and made 
incriminating statements that were used against him54. On the basis of 
53 The only advantage that results from the judgment in the Ibrahim and Others 
case appears to be the fact that the ECtHR expressly confirmed that the right 
to be assisted by a lawyer applies from the moment a person is accused of an 
offense in the autonomous sense of the term given to it by the ECtHR case 
law. Therefore, the right does not apply from the time of the first interroga-
tion, when the person is formally presented with charges, but from the time 
of the first action of the authorities conducting the process that is aimed to 
prosecute the person. See also the discussion on the Ibrahim and Others case,

recent judgments of the Court55, it must be assumed that the aim is no 
longer to ensure that every suspect has access to a lawyer before the first 
questioning and, in the event of a failure to fulfill that obligation, to declare 
a breach of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR. The exclusion of incriminating 
statements obtained during such a questioning as evidence in the trial 
is also less important. What becomes more and more important is the 
right to be informed about the content of the charges and the right to 
remain silent, and not to be forced to make statements in the absence of 
a lawyer if the suspect has refused to make them or has stated that he 
or she would not make any statements until he or she has consulted a 
lawyer. The ECtHR stresses that in principle there can be no justification 
for a failure to notify a suspect of these rights. 
Such a conclusion can be reached by reading of the judgment in 
the Simeonovi v. Bulgaria case56, which argues that the lack of information 
about rights, the fact that advantage was taken of a person’s insufficient 
awareness of his rights, and the violation of the right not to incriminate 
oneself violates the fairness of the proceedings more than a temporary 
restriction of contact with a lawyer. 
The Court’s position expressed in the Ibrahim and Others case is 
also followed in the Beuze v. Belgium case57. In the Beuze case, a two-step 
test was introduced, in accordance with which the Court ought first of all 
to consider whether there are compelling reasons that justify restricting

an applicant’s access to a lawyer. In the absence of such compelling 
reasons, the Court should merely apply a “strict scrutiny” to the second 
stage of the test, which requires an assessment of the overall fairness of 
the proceedings, using the criteria from the Ibrahim and Others case58. 
In this judgment, the ECtHR departed from its earlier assumption that a 
restriction on access to a lawyer of a systemic nature (i.e. where national 
legislation prohibits contact with a defense counsel) results in automatic 
violation of Article 6 § 1 and § 3 (c) of the ECHR.
The above position was quite soon confirmed in the Zherdev v. 
Ukraine59 and Doyle v. Ireland case60. In the first judgement, the ECtHR 
pointed out that the courts deciding the case did not rely on an admission 
made in the absence of alawyer. The defendant was also allowed to 
challenge the authenticity of the incriminating evidence at the trial, he 
did not withdraw his guilty plea, and there was other decisive evidence 
that determined the conviction. Given that the case involved murder, 
the ECtHR had no doubt that there was a public interest in holding the 
perpetrator criminally liable. Consequently, the ECtHR assumed, despite 
the applicant’s age, that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 and 
§ 3 (c) of the ECHR. The significance of inculpatory evidence other 
than the confession and the defendant’s procedural position in the main 
proceedings weighed on this decision.
A similar conclusion was reached by the ECHR, in the Doyle v. 
Ireland case. In that judgment the Court concluded that there had been 
no breach of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the ECHR, although the total time for 
interrogation of the suspect in the pre-trial phase was 31 hours and 
the duration of the contact with a lawyer at that stage of the criminal 
proceedings was 42 minutes. It is a fact that there was contact with a 
lawyer, but two circumstances must be highlighted. Firstly, the time of 
contact with the lawyer was disproportionately short in relation to the

total length of the several interrogations and it took place before and 
never during the interrogations. The question of whether it is possible to 
provide effective legal assistance in such a short period of time should be 
considered to be rhetorical61. One must agree with the critical view of this 
judgment, which was expressed in a dissenting opinion to the judgment 
in the Doyle v. Ireland case by judge Ganna Yudkivska. She stated that in 
that case, not only is it impossible to speak (regardless of the reasons 
for such a duration of the contacts) of provision of any effective legal 
assistance, but “in principle the circumstances constituted a complete 
mockery of legal assistance.” 
The Doyle v. Ireland case involved factual circumstances similar to the 
Salduz case, in which the applicant’s restricted access to a lawyer arose from 
a systemic, mandatory, and general restriction of suspects’ access to a lawyer 
in the respondent state’s national law. Such a restriction was determined 
to have irreparably prejudiced the proceedings and thereby constituted 
a violation of Article 6 § 1 and § 3 (c) of the Convention. This case thus 
illustrates that the Court has made a dramatic U-turn from one of its most 
progressive judgments, the Salduz case, with its unequivocal prohibition 
of any blanket restriction on defense rights. The cases presented above 
demonstrate that a mere violation of the right to contact a counsel does not 
automatically give rise to a finding of unfairness of the pending proceedings. 
Such a conclusion can be reached only after it has been established that the 
conduct as a whole violated the standards arising under Article 6 § 1 and § 
3 (c) of the Convention. The vagueness of the criteria set out in the Ibrahim 
and Others case not only makes the jurisprudence of the ECHR far from 
consistent, but also undermines the rights of the defense and the fairness of 
the proceedings. Those cases in which, in the absence of a counsel, evidence 
was admittedly obtained, but was not incriminating, do not appear to be 
61 In her dissenting opinion, ECtHR judge Ganna Yudkivska raises further ques-
tions: Did the length of contact between the suspect and the lawyer allow for 
consideration of different defense strategies? Can we allege that a thorough 
discussion of the applicant’s previous interview and preparation for the sub-
sequent one took place each time? It is noteworthy that even during the ap-
plicant’s crucial 15th interview, prior to making his confession, his commu-
nication with his solicitor lasted for only 4 minutes. More information can be 
found in the ECtHR judgment of 24 May 2019 in the case of Doyle v. Ireland, 
application no. 51979/17.2008 | SAkowIcz, Andrzej.

controversial. Of concern are those cases where incriminating evidence was 
obtained in the absence of a counsel and the ECtHR did not find a violation 
of the general fairness of the proceedings. 
V. conclu SIon
The case law of the ECtHR sets the standard of protection of rights 
and freedoms in the territory of those Member States of the Council of 
Europe that have ratified the Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950. The analysis carried out 
showed the clear evaluation of the case law of the ECtHR in relation to 
the standard of access of a suspected offender to an advocate at the initial 
stage of criminal prosecution. The first breakthrough was the judgment 
in the Salduz case, which defined the scope of the right to lawyer and 
the fairness of the proceedings. First, suspects must be able to enter into 
contact with a lawyer from the time when they are taken into custody. In 
particular, this possibility should exist before the suspect is questioned. 
Second, suspects have the right to the physical presence of an attorney 
during initial police interrogation. This opportunity should also exist 
when they are questioned in the subsequent pre-trial proceedings. And 
third, it is forbidden to use incriminating statements obtained during an 
interrogation held in the absence of a lawyer. 
The standard of access to a lawyer adopted in the Salduz and post-
Saladuz case-law increased the protection of a defendant and strengthen 
his/her position in the criminal proceedings, building up clear European 
standard of access to a lawyer. This standard was also beneficial to the 
adversarial model of criminal procedure. It forced the prosecutorial organs 
to find convincing evidence of guilt instead of simply relying on self-
incriminating statements of a suspect provided without prior consultation 
with a lawyer. It appeared that the judgment in the Salduz case, which 
was a Strasbourg equivalent of the US Supreme Court’s 1963 judgment in 
the Miranda v. Arizona case, would become a permanent part of the case 
law of the ECtHR62. Unfortunately, in the subsequent case-law the Court

decided to water down the strict approach applied in Salduz case. After 8 
years of the Salduz doctrine, the Court took a significant step backwards 
in 2016 with its judgment in the Ibrahim and Others case.  It withdrew 
from the previous assumption that the absence of reasonable grounds for 
restricting access to a lawyer automatically results in a violation of the 
right to a fair trial. Instead, the ECtHR adopted an open and imprecise 
list of failings that should be taken into account when assessing the 
fairness of the criminal proceedings as a whole. This approach prevents 
the formulation of clear country-specific guidelines on how to ensure 
effective access to a lawyer for suspects, but also how to ensure the fairness 
of a criminal trial at an early stage of criminal procedure.
